## 1. Business Architecture & Channel Routing

### Core Model & Target Personas
* **Primary Offerings:**
  1. **New Enterprise Dell Hardware:** B2B commercial fleet procurement (OptiPlex, Latitude, PowerEdge).
  2. **Refurbished Dell Hardware:** Certified pre-owned and workshop-inspected business devices.
* **Service Coverage:** Western Cape (Cape Town CBD, Bellville, Century City, Montague Gardens, Stellenbosch, Somerset West).
* **Target Personas:**
  * *Persona A (Enterprise Procurement):* CIOs, Corporate IT Managers, Procurement Directors (Focus: New hardware, volume discounts, official OEM warranties, long-life fleets).
  * *Persona B (Value-Focused IT):* SMB Owners, Call Centers, Startups, Systems Integrators (Focus: Cost savings per unit, Grade-A condition, immediate local availability).

### Channel Separation Rule (STRICT)
**New Dell Commercial** and **Refurbished Dell Hardware** MUST NOT be combined on the same catalog grid or hero section without explicit toggle filters or separate landing pages, to avoid keyword cannibalization and conversion friction.

## 5. SEO & Copywriting Guidelines (Western Cape Context)

### Target Keywords Matrix
- **New Dell Channel:** dell optiplex distributor cape town, dell latitude fleet procurement, dell commercial desktop bellville, dell server supplier century city
- **Refurbished Channel:** refurbished dell laptops cape town, pre-owned optiplex western cape, cheap business laptops montague gardens, second hand dell latitude stellenbosch

### Geo-Targeting Rules
Always weave Western Cape commercial/industrial hubs into local landing page copy:
- **Cape Town CBD:** financial, corporate, legal enterprise fleets.
- **Century City & Bellville:** managed service providers (MSPs), tech parks, call centers.
- **Montague Gardens & Paarden Eiland:** logistics, industrial IT, warehousing.
- **Stellenbosch & Somerset West:** agri-tech, educational, enterprise offices.

---

## 6. Anti-Slop & Prompt Constraints (Hard Rules)
- **No Mixed Catalogs:** Never generate a unified UI card grid that mixes new and refurbished items without explicit toggle filters or tabbed navigation.
- **B2B CTAs:** Do not use consumer e-commerce terms like "Add to Cart" for enterprise fleets. Use "Request B2B Quote", "Apply for Fleet Pricing", or "Check Cape Town Stock".
- **No Generic Stock Placeholders:** Component cards must feature real Dell series names (OptiPlex 7000 MFF, Latitude 5540, PowerEdge R760) and Western Cape delivery badges.
- **Accessibility Standard:** Maintain a minimum 4.5:1 text-to-background contrast ratio on all UI elements (WCAG 2.2 AA/AAA compliance).

## Implementation note
The current live site (`index.html` + FAQ/Terms/Privacy/Resources pages) is a single-page inline-styled build, not React/Tailwind, and has no product catalog yet (no SKUs, stock counts, or pricing data). Building the `/dell-commercial/` and `/refurbished-dell/` catalog pages described here is a larger project requiring real product/inventory data — flag when ready to scope that build.
